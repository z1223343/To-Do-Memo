## Unfinished Project & Future Ideas

1. Self-driving car project 5 (highway vehicle detection) : 3D bounding box detection
2. Deep Reinforcement Learning project 3 (Multi-agent training) : MADDPG
3. TBD

4). Extrapolate
This is the most interesting part since the approach is not introduced in courses. I have different ideas to process the image, but unfortunately I am not enough familiar with python’s functions. Here I use a very straightforward approach that calculates the average value of the left/right line’s slope and intercept. And I also use slope range to get rid of unreasonable lines. It works well. But it is still a little unstable, and I may apply Kalman filter later to reduce noise.
